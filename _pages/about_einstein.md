Welcome to my portfolio, my name is Kaden Berger, I am currently a sophomore in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University (ISU). Throughout my website you can find my contact information, projects I have worked on, my work experience, and other information about me. Thank you for your interest and feel free to contanct me at my email if you have any questions.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
